   <TRp TRkey='279638703f'>The Location of Lancelet on the Species Evolution Map</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='b0aef23d0b'>Because there are more kinds of amino acids than bases, the similarity of amino acid sequences can show the relationship between species to a certain extent. For example, the 67 and 68 amino acids in the amino acid sequence are PN in lancelet and sea urchin, and GP in other species. Similarly, the 106 to 109 amino acids are IKEV in cathepsin B sequence of lancelet, which is highly consistent with sea urchin, but has low similarity with other species. Therefore, lancelet has close evolutionary relationship with invertebrates such as sea urchins. On the other hand, at some amino acid sites, such as 60 and 61 amino acids, sea urchins showed ML, but LC in other species; as 204 to 206 amino acids, TKG in sea urchins and SRP in other species. To some extent, this reflects the relationship between lancelet and vertebrates. Therefore, we infer that amphioxus is a transitional animal between invertebrates and invertebrates on the phylogenetic map by sequence alignment of cathepsin B.</TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='981be66c31'>MOE Dock was used for molecular docking of CTSB with the small molecule and predicting the binding affinity. Small molecule was defined as ligand and CTSB as target. The 2D structures of small molecule were converted to 3D in MOE through energy minimization. Then the protonation state of target and the orientation of the hydrogens were optimized by LigX, at the PH of 7 and temperature of 300 K. Prior to docking, the force field of AMBER10:EHT and the implicit solvation model of Reaction Field (R-field) were selected. The binding site was identified by superpose CTSB with the original template structure, the position where the ligand in template structure was defined as binding site of CTSB. The docking workflow followed the โinduced fitโ protocol, in which the side chains of the receptor pocket were allowed to move according to ligand conformations, with a constraint on their positions. The weight used for tethering side chain atoms to their original positions was 10. All docked poses of molecules were ranked by London dG scoring first, then a force field refinement was carried out on the top 30 poses followed by a rescoring of GBVI/WSA dG. The best ranked pose was selected as the final binding mode.</TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='8aa6fd44d4'>Results:</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='44bc8af5c5'>Why only amphioxus cathepsin B can degrade microcystin?</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='40b64e8211'>The interaction between cathepsin B and microcystin LR is simulated by molecular docking (microcystin LR and microcystin RR are the two main microcystins). The results of molecular docking show that the interaction sites between cathepsin B and microcystin LR were GLY-90, CYX-92, CYX-184, and LEU-261, respectively. The sequence alignment results above were labeled with #. Three of them were highly conserved in the evolution of species, and the amino acid LEU-261 was conserved in the alignment results. Though they were different amino acids, they still belonged to the same class. Although the action sites are highly conserved, the alignment results show that there are differences in the amino acid sequence environment around the action sites. Compared with other species, there are some unique amino acid fragments around the cathepsin B site of lancelet, which are labeled with grey background. We infer that it is these fragments that influence the spatial structure around the action sites that enable cathepsin B in amphioxus to interact with algae toxin, capture and complete the digestion of algae toxin.</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='755905a5f3'>At the same time, by comparing the structures of microcystin LR and microcystin RR, the structural differences between the two kinds of microcystin are only one branch far from benzene ring. The results of molecular docking show that the amino acid sites of cathepsin B interacting with algae toxin generally concentrate around the common branched chains of the two algae toxins, so we judged that the structural differences between the two algae toxins had no decisive effect on the recognition of enzymes and the two algae toxins. The branches of MC-LR and MC-RR are mainly different in electron giving ability, which may influence the interaction of enzymes and the two algae toxins. It is also consistent with our experimental results that cathepsin B can independently decompose microcystin LR and microcystin RR, and shows better effect on MC-LR degradation.</TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='9020a0fea6'>In the wet lab experiments, we found that carboxypeptidase Z/N and subtilisin-like protein could not decompose microcystin independently, but when the two enzymes were put into the experiment, they could decompose one of the microcystin, microcystin RR. By comparing with the sequence of cathepsin B (Fig. 3), we found that several action sites of cathepsin B could find similar short peptide structures in these two amino acid sequences. GLY-90, CYX-92 and LEU-261 were found in carboxypeptidase Z/N, while CYX-184 was found in subtilisin-like protease. We speculate that both enzymes are involved in the capture and decomposition of microcystin RR at the same time. However, due to the harsh external environment produced by the simultaneous action of the two enzymes, the three-dimensional structure of the acting algal toxin substrates is limited, so the two enzymes can only decompose microcystin RR and cannot interact with microcystin LR.</TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='b981385dd2'>The degradation effect showed obvious time and concentration gradient. After 12 hours, tube 1 (1:500) has basically been degraded and turned into milky white liquid. According to analysis, its main component is small peptide.</TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='215878fcae'>Compared Figure. 13 and Figure. 14, it can be found that the small molecular weight increases significantly, indicating that most algae are degraded into small molecular nutrients. The degradation effect is obvious.</TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='8eeaa531fb'>In addition, the content of algal toxin was detected by HPLC. After 6 hours, the content of algal toxin in the sample was lower than 10 ug/L, which means no toxic. </TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='ff69a002cf'>The purpose of this part of the experiment is to verify whether the living engineering bacteria can realize the degradation of algae, so as to show the stability of the expression system we constructed and the efficiency of the induced expression means. It can be seen from the picture that the degradation effect of engineering bacteria is similar to that of enzyme preparation in figure 12, with the solution in the tube turned into milky white suspension. The degradation effect is obvious and our engineered bacteria are effective.</TRp>
   <TRH3 TRkey='ce138b4363'>4. Screening proteins for algal toxin degradation</TRH3>
   <TRp TRkey='0450a9f447'>High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; formerly referred to as high-pressure liquid chromatography) is a technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. We use HPLC to test the content of microcystin in all the 110 samples.</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='dc988b0fc1'>The 28 proteins list and their order numbers are shown in <Link href='#results-table-2'>Table 2</Link>.</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='d7f7f67322'>We decided to screen microcystin degrading enzymes from 28 proteins instead of 12, because for the degradation of microcystin, in addition to digestion, immune function may also play a role. Therefore, we directly selected 28 related proteins which expressed the most in the expression profile of amphioxus.</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='a7f3edff85'>In general, our reaction system are enzymes and microcystin mixed at 1:1 (by weight) in PBS buffer, including protein 1,2, ... 28 + MC-LR/MC-RR, and (1+8), (2+8), ... (28+8) + MC-LR/MC-RR. <Link href={rr.HPLC$zip}>The HPLC of all this sample are list here.</Link></TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='d296374b27'>To illustrate the specific analysis process, we use cathepsin B (2+MCLR) as an example.</TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='af8fcdab36'>Peak area is directly proportional to the concentration of Microcystin. Compared figure 16 and figure 17, the degradation effect of protein 2 (cathepsin B) to MC-LR is significant๏ผwhose final microcystin concentration is 1/10 of protein 1 (cathepsin D).</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='526335689d'>The specific relationship between the peak area and the concentration of microcystin can be obtained by preparing the standard solution with concentration gradient.

   <TRp TRkey='bfcf958def'>Analysis of the above data shows that:</TRp>
   <DocOrderedList items={[

   ]} />
   <TRp TRkey='ed8dba1e7a'>All of these results have been partially explained by our molecular docking model. Four binding loci between protein 2 and MC-LR have been found and located. We found that protein 12 and 8 separately have part of the binding loci in protein 2. That explains they need synergistic mechanism to take effect. <Link href='/Model'>Click here to get more.</Link></TRp>

   <TRp TRkey='f8c8938f1e'>In addition to screening the degradation enzymes, we also analyzed the reaction mechanism as much as possible. We calculate the structure through the sequence, and predict the function through the structure. After experimental verification, we explain the reaction mechanism through structure, and finally return to sequence specificity. We think that's the core attraction of synthetic biology, and thatโs iGEMerโs pleasure - to practice central rule in our own project.</TRp>

   <TRH3 TRkey='0ba59c7f31'>5. Characterization of key protein</TRH3>
   <TRp TRkey='d7c183d729'>We further characterized the key proteins in our enzymatic preparation. The main characterization method is enzyme activity test kit.</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='cfe9a876f9'>In fact, the enzyme activity kit itself is a test of our annotation effect. For example, we think that part of the sequence of protein 2 is similar to the main domain of cathepsin B, so we name it amphioxus cathepsin B. But whether it is really a kind of cathepsin B should be determined by its reaction with the standard substrate.</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='75dcc82b73'>This also tests whether our expression system is effective, which means these eukaryotic enzymes, after our optimization, can be expressed and remain active in prokaryotic system.</TRp>
   <TRp TRkey='188bdadd02'>Finally, enzyme activity and enzyme kinetic characterization are also important parts of the whole experimental process. It represents the quality of our part and our protein to some extent.</TRp>

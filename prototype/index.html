      <h1>Project Description</h1>
      <h2>Why is it so urgent to deal with algae bloom?</h2>
      <p>
         As a highly reproducible algae, Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) can reproduce infinitely as long as
         there is adequate nutrition, which leads to the outbreak of Cyanobacteria all over the world.
         Under the background of global warming and ocean acidification, large scale of Cyanobacteria bloom-forming
         is unavoidable. Not only responsible for water quality deterioration, landscape destroy and foul smell
         emission, Blue-green algae bloom is also accused of blocking gas exchange between water and air, causing
         serious death of aquatic organisms.
